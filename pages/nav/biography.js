      <p>
        Born and raised in Upper Darby, Pennsylvania, my Web development journey
        started at the age of 16 when I bought my first domain name and hosted
        my first website.<br></br> Several years later, I briefly attended
        Drexel University persuing a degree in Computer Science withdrawling
        after two terms due to financial reason. Truthfully, I was on my way to
        flunking out and was under prepared and immature for the stresses that
        came with collegiate life in my early twenties.
